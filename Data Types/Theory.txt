# PYTHON DATA TYPES (THEORY)
# =========================
#
# Data types in Python define the type of data a variable can store.
# They help Python understand how much memory to allocate and what
# operations can be performed on the data.
#
# In AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science, correct usage of data
# types is critical because models work on numerical representations
# of real-world data.
#
# -------------------------
# 1. int (Integer)
# -------------------------
# Used to store whole numbers without decimal points.
# Examples: counts, indexes, epochs, batch sizes.
# Commonly used for loop counters and dataset sizes.
#
# -------------------------
# 2. float (Floating Point)
# -------------------------
# Used to store decimal or real numbers.
# Essential in AI/ML for weights, biases, loss values,
# learning rates, and probability scores.
#
# -------------------------
# 3. str (String)
# -------------------------
# Used to store textual data.
# Real-world data such as user input, reviews, labels,
# file paths, and dataset names are usually strings
# before preprocessing.
#
# -------------------------
# 4. bool (Boolean)
# -------------------------
# Stores True or False values.
# Used for decision making, conditions, flags,
# and controlling program flow in ML pipelines.
#
# -------------------------
# 5. list
# -------------------------
# An ordered, mutable collection of elements.
# Used to store multiple values such as features,
# temporary data batches, and raw input values.
#
# -------------------------
# 6. tuple
# -------------------------
# An ordered, immutable collection of elements.
# Used when data should not be changed, such as
# image dimensions, fixed configurations, or model shapes.
#
# -------------------------
# 7. dict (Dictionary)
# -------------------------
# Stores data in key-value pairs.
# Very useful for structured data like JSON objects,
# model configurations, API responses, and feature mappings.
#
# -------------------------
# 8. set
# -------------------------
# An unordered collection of unique elements.
# Used to remove duplicate values and store
# unique labels or categories in datasets.
#
# -------------------------
# Importance in AI/ML
# -------------------------
# Correct data type usage improves:
# - Performance
# - Memory efficiency
# - Model accuracy
# - Code readability and maintainability
#
# Almost all AI/ML workflows involve converting
# raw data (strings) into numerical data (int/float)
# before feeding it into machine learning models.
