# PYTHON LISTS (THEORY)
# =========================
#
# A list in Python is an ordered, mutable collection of elements.
# Lists can store multiple values of different data types
# such as integers, floats, strings, and even other lists.
#
# Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in
# Python, especially in AI, Machine Learning, and Data Science.
#
# -------------------------
# List Creation
# -------------------------
# Lists are created using square brackets [].
# Elements are separated by commas.
#
# -------------------------
# Mutability of Lists
# -------------------------
# Lists are mutable, meaning their elements can be
# modified, added, or removed after creation.
#
# This makes lists suitable for dynamic data handling
# during preprocessing and intermediate computations.
#
# -------------------------
# Indexing and Slicing
# -------------------------
# List elements can be accessed using indexes.
# Indexing starts from 0.
# Slicing is used to access a range of elements.
#
# -------------------------
# Common List Operations
# -------------------------
# - Adding elements
# - Removing elements
# - Updating values
# - Iterating through elements
#
# -------------------------
# List Methods
# -------------------------
# Python provides built-in methods such as:
# append(), insert(), extend(), remove(), pop(),
# clear(), index(), count(), sort(), reverse(), copy()
#
# These methods are heavily used in data manipulation
# and preprocessing tasks.
#
# -------------------------
# Real-World AI/ML Usage
# -------------------------
# - Storing dataset values before converting to NumPy arrays
# - Holding feature names
# - Batch processing data
# - Collecting predictions or evaluation results
#
# -------------------------
# Importance in AI/ML
# -------------------------
# Lists act as a bridge between raw data and
# optimized numerical structures like NumPy arrays.
#
# Understanding lists is essential for:
# - Data preprocessing
# - Algorithm implementation
# - Logic building
#
# -------------------------
# Key Takeaway
# -------------------------
# Lists provide flexibility and ease of use.
# They are ideal for temporary storage and manipulation
# of data in AI/ML workflows.
