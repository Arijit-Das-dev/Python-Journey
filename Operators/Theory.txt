# =========================
# PYTHON OPERATORS (THEORY)
# =========================
#
# Operators in Python are special symbols used to perform
# operations on variables and values.
#
# In AI/ML and Data Science, operators are used heavily in:
# - Mathematical computations
# - Logical decision making
# - Data preprocessing
# - Model training calculations
#
# -------------------------
# 1. Arithmetic Operators
# -------------------------
# Used to perform mathematical operations.
#
# +   Addition
# -   Subtraction
# *   Multiplication
# /   Division (returns float)
# //  Floor division
# %   Modulus (remainder)
# **  Exponentiation (power)
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Loss calculation
# - Weight updates
# - Feature scaling
#
# -------------------------
# 2. Assignment Operators
# -------------------------
# Used to assign values to variables.
#
# =    Assign
# +=   Add and assign
# -=   Subtract and assign
# *=   Multiply and assign
# /=   Divide and assign
# //=  Floor divide and assign
# %=   Modulus and assign
# **=  Power and assign
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Updating weights
# - Accumulating loss values
#
# -------------------------
# 3. Comparison Operators
# -------------------------
# Used to compare two values.
# Always return True or False.
#
# ==   Equal to
# !=   Not equal to
# >    Greater than
# <    Less than
# >=   Greater than or equal to
# <=   Less than or equal to
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Threshold checks
# - Accuracy evaluation
# - Conditional logic in pipelines
#
# -------------------------
# 4. Logical Operators
# -------------------------
# Used to combine conditional statements.
#
# and   Returns True if both conditions are True
# or    Returns True if at least one condition is True
# not   Reverses the condition
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Filtering data
# - Controlling training flow
# - Rule-based systems
#
# -------------------------
# 5. Identity Operators
# -------------------------
# Used to compare memory locations.
#
# is       Returns True if both variables refer to same object
# is not   Returns True if variables refer to different objects
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Checking object references
# - Debugging memory-related issues
#
# -------------------------
# 6. Membership Operators
# -------------------------
# Used to test whether a value exists in a sequence.
#
# in       Returns True if value is present
# not in   Returns True if value is not present
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Feature selection
# - Label validation
# - Dataset filtering
#
# -------------------------
# 7. Bitwise Operators
# -------------------------
# Perform operations at the binary level.
#
# &   AND
# |   OR
# ^   XOR
# ~   NOT
# <<  Left shift
# >>  Right shift
#
# AI/ML usage:
# - Low-level optimization
# - Embedded and performance-critical systems
#
# -------------------------
# Importance in AI/ML
# -------------------------
# Operators form the backbone of:
# - Mathematical modeling
# - Data transformation
# - Decision making
#
# Without operators, no learning algorithm,
# preprocessing step, or evaluation metric can function.
