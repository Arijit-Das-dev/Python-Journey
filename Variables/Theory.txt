What are variables ?
Variables store changing information while a program is running.

In AI/ML:

1. Data changes
2. Model parameters change
3. Predictions change
4.Metrics change

Without variables:
AI systems cannot learn, adapt, or make decisions

Real problem they solve
Imagine:

Input data = millions of records
Model weights = updated every training step
Accuracy = recalculated every epoch
You must store and update values continuously → variables do this.
No variables = no learning.

Variable Naming Rules :

=> Must start with a letter or underscore (_)
=> Can contain letters, numbers, or underscores
=> Case-sensitive (Loss ≠ loss)
=> Cannot use Python keywords (if, for, while, etc.)
=> No spaces or special characters

Best Practices for AI/ML:

Use descriptive names: learning_rate, num_epochs, training_loss

Use snake_case for variables, UPPERCASE for constants

Avoid ambiguous single-letter names except in loops (i, j
