PYTHON CONTROL STATEMENTS
=============================

Control statements control the flow of execution of a program.
They decide:
• which code runs
• how many times it runs
• when to stop execution

--------------------------------
TYPES OF CONTROL STATEMENTS
--------------------------------

1. Conditional Statements
2. Looping Statements
3. Jump / Control Transfer Statements

================================
1. CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS
================================

Conditional statements execute code based on conditions.

a if statement
   → Executes block when condition is True

b if-else statement
   → Executes one block if True, another if False

c if-elif-else ladder
   → Used when multiple conditions are checked

d Nested if
   → if statement inside another if

--------------------------------
Use Case:
• Decision making
• Validation logic
• AI rule-based systems

================================
2. LOOPING STATEMENTS
================================

Loops are used to execute a block of code repeatedly.

a for loop
   → Used when number of iterations is known
   → Iterates over sequence (list, tuple, string, range

b while loop
   → Used when condition-based repetition is required
   → Runs until condition becomes False

--------------------------------
Use Case:
• Traversing data
• Training loops in ML
• Batch processing

================================
3. JUMP / CONTROL TRANSFER STATEMENTS
================================

These statements change the normal flow of loops.

a break
   → Terminates the loop immediately

b continue
   → Skips current iteration and moves to next

c pass
   → Does nothing (used as placeholder

--------------------------------
Use Case:
• Loop control
• Skipping invalid data
• Structuring unfinished logic

================================
IMPORTANT NOTES
================================
• Python uses indentation instead of braces
• Conditions must evaluate to True or False
• Improper control flow leads to logical errors

================================
REAL-WORLD APPLICATIONS
================================
• User authentication systems
• Data filtering
• AI decision pipelines
• Backend validation logic
